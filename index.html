                <p>The Lord's Prayer</p>
                <p>Today we will be praying with the Our Father. In Matthew's gospel, Jesus introduces with
                    the instruction: "This is how you are to pray." Think about how many times you have said 
                    this prayer from memory without thinking much about what you are saying. Savor this 
                    opportunity to go deep on the words, meaning, and source of the Lord's Prayer. If this 
                    is your first time seeing the Our Father, what a place to journey towards a deeper
                    relationship with God.

                "This is how you are to pray: Our Father in heaven, 
                hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will 
                be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us today our 
                daily bread; and forgive us our debts, as we forgive
                our debtors; and do not subject us to the final test,
                but deliver us from the evil one."

                    Re-read the passage and reflect on what stood out to you.
                    what might the Lord be trying to tell you?

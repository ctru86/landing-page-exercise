                <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #E5E7EB;">Today, we will be praying with the Our Father. In Matthew's gospel, Jesus introduces the prayer with
                    this instruction: "This is how you are to pray."Whether the Lord's Prayer is new to you or you have prayed it countless times without  
                    without thinking much about what you are saying, savor this opportunity to reflect deeply on the words, meaning, and source of this prayer.
